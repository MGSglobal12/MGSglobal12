# Priscillar Simon (McMillan) Banda (MPH, P.Dip Business Strategy, B.Ed)

**Solutions Architect | Google Developer Program Lead - Reno | Mandela Washington Fellow | AI Educator | Board Member | Women Tech Makers**

I am a passionate and accomplished technology professional, currently serving as the Database Specialist at the Northern Nevada International Centre, an organization affiliated with the University of Nevada, Reno, dedicated to enhancing diplomacy and global relations. My expertise spans across solutions architecture, SQL, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

My journey in technology began with the development of one of Zambia's pioneering e-commerce platforms, Zamstores. This venture ignited my enthusiasm for tech and propelled me into a dynamic career where I continuously strive to innovate and lead.

As the Google Developer Program Lead for Reno, I am committed to fostering a vibrant tech community, supporting developers, and driving technological advancements. My role as an AI educator and Women Tech Makers ambassador allows me to empower underrepresented groups in tech, advocating for diversity and inclusion.

A proud Mandela Washington Fellow, I leverage my international education and experience to mentor and coach young entrepreneurs and professionals. My mission is to inspire others to abandon the victim mindset, embrace resilience, and achieve their fullest potential in the tech industry.

I am a lifelong learner, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and share my insights with those around me. Whether through professional engagements or community initiatives, I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact in the world of technology and beyond.
